(1)Instead of using "npx parcel index.html", we can mention that inside package.json script section. If we type "npm start", it will consider "npm run start" as start is a reserved keyword.

(2)JSX : It is an extension of javascript which use HTML like syntax.
    -Babel convert JXS to react element. like: "<h1>Heading</h1>" will be converted to React.createElement('h1', {}, 'Heading') by babbel
    -we can use {} to pass any valid JS
    -For multiline we will use ()

(3)React Component - Class Component (Older way) & Functional Component (New approach)

(4)React Functional Component : This is a function which will return a JSX.
    -Function name should starts with uppercase
    -We can pass one component inside another component which is known as "component composotion".
    We can use any one of the below approach to render a component : 
    <component />
    <component></component>
    {component()}
