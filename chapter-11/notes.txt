(1)Higher order component : It's a function which takes a component as parameter and return the enhanced version of that component .


Practical Work : 
(1) Create a higher order component inside restcardcomponent to show top rated restaurant with a label. From body component  call that higher order function and call that as per the rating condition.
(2)Update restaurant menu page and show all menu as per category by using accordian.
(3)Make sure to collapse all accordian and show the one accordinan which is clicked by using both below methods.
-uncontrolled component : the control is with the child : Add logic to expand colapse according to restaurantmenucategory componenet itself
-controlled component : where we can control the child component : Remove the accordian logic from restaurantmenucategory and move that to the parent compoent
-lifting the state up : We can not direactly call the setUseState method from child component. So we can pass the reference function as props to child component and call that. Implement the same to open 1 accordian at a time.
